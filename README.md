Some more description will be added once everything is finalised later in the review process, but for now, R markdown documents describing all of the analyses run are in r_markdown - following the numbered .Rmd documents in order will run through all database building, classification of samples, processing and analysis of classifications and figure generation. These are available as HTML documents [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lvlz2wpsssvsrad/AAA48jOBHuwc5CBCO5_KUtvUa/R_code_markdown?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1) and all databases and intermediate files created during analysis are on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lvlz2wpsssvsrad/AAC-BkJja8LvlDoNDB4qgnHNa?dl=0).
